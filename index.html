<h2>About</h2>

<p>
I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at University College London, working on multimodal artificial intelligence for early detection of oral cancer. My research focuses on integrating genetic data with medical imaging to develop more accurate and early diagnostic tools.
</p>

<p>
My background spans neuromorphic vision, event-based perception, multimodal learning, and computer vision for robotics and healthcare. I have extensive experience in data collection, annotation, model development, evaluation, and presenting research at international venues.
</p>

<p>
Before joining UCL, I completed my PhD in Artificial Intelligence at Kingston University, developing methods for event-based visual perception using Generative Neural Networks, Transformers, Graph Neural Networks, and Spiking Neural Networks. I also worked as a Data Scientist in industry (Santander, HomeProtect), building ML systems for computer vision, NLP, and anomaly detection.
</p>

<p>
My work has been published in leading journals such as <em>Nature Scientific Data</em>, <em>Pattern Recognition</em>, and <em>IEEE Access</em>, and recognised with the Best Paper Award at the CVPR Event-Based Vision Workshop.
