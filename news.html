  <h3>Research Featured by Khalifa University</h3>
  <p>
    My work on event-based panoptic segmentation was recently highlighted by 
    Khalifa University in an article showcasing advances in robotic grasping 
    and autonomous perception. The feature discusses our approach to combining 
    neuromorphic event-based data with deep learning architectures to improve 
    segmentation accuracy and robustness in cluttered environments.

    The article covers our contributions, including the development of 
    asynchronous event-based segmentation models and the broader impact on 
    robotics and intelligent systems.
