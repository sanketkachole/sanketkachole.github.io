<h3>Multimodal AI for Oral Cancer Detection</h3>
<p>
At UCL, I develop multimodal AI models that integrate genetic data and medical imaging to improve early detection of oral cancer. This work involves designing deep learning architectures capable of fusing heterogeneous biomedical data to support accurate prediction and diagnosis.

<h3>Event-Based Vision and Neuromorphic Perception</h3>
<p>
My PhD research focused on neuromorphic vision systems for robotic perception. I developed fused RGB-event segmentation networks, event augmentation techniques, and spiking-neuron inspired models for asynchronous visual processing. This includes work on panoptic segmentation using graph-based neural architectures.

<h3>Generative Models for Robotic Understanding</h3>
<p>
I have built generative deep learning frameworks for pose prediction, object segmentation, and motion analysis using pressure maps and event streams. These models were designed for structured prediction tasks in robotics and human–computer interaction.

<h3>Machine Learning for Real-World Applications</h3>
<p>
In industry, I have developed production ML pipelines for image segmentation, claim classification, fraud and risk analysis, and anomaly detection. My work includes transformer-based NLP systems and vision-transformer segmentation models deployed in operational environments.
