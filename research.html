        <h3>Multimodal AI for Oral Cancer Detection</h3>
        <p>
          At UCL, I am developing multimodal AI methods that combine genetic profiles and medical
          imaging to improve early detection of oral cancer. This work involves designing and
          training deep learning models that can fuse heterogeneous clinical and imaging data to
          support more accurate and earlier diagnosis.

        <h3>Neuromorphic Vision and Event-Based Perception</h3>
        <p>
          My PhD research focused on advancing autonomous perception in robotics using neuromorphic
          vision systems. I have developed models for event-based segmentation and panoptic
          perception, combining RGB frames and event data with architectures such as SegNet,
          transformers, graph neural networks, and spiking neural networks.

        <h3>Machine Learning in Real-World Systems</h3>
        <p>
          In industry roles as a Data Scientist, I have built and deployed machine learning models
          for computer vision, NLP, and risk modelling, including claim classification, motion
          prediction, and anomaly detection, with a focus on robust pipelines and production-grade
          code.
